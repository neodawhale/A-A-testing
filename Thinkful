Assignment:
For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. 
Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, but the initial design. There is plenty of room for interpretation here, 
so make sure to state what assumptions you're making.


1)You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one 
version of the email in February and the other in May.

This is an example of sampling bias. Advertising bathing suits in February isn't 
a good choice because the weather is chilly around that time. It's winter! No one is 
thinking about bathing suits. In May, where it's a lot warmer, people will begin to think 
about purchasing bathing suits if they haven't already. 



2) You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a 
higher rate of anxiety than the general population.

This is an example of observer bias. You expect people to feel better when going to the clinic. 
People with anxiety feel anxious when going to the doctor for anything.



3)You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website 
visits in the first week.

This is an example of contextual bias. In the first week, you become confident You 
confident in your business due to the first few days of the week. You 
normally see billboards on highways. Using billboards on popular highways is
a good thing. People are driving all the time as well. When sitting in traffic,
or just simply driving by, they often notice the billboards. 



4)You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.

This is also an example of contextual(?). When lauching a new program period, you want to give people time to look over and
decide whether or not the program will benefit them. As a result, you may not see
a quick change in visits in the first week.
